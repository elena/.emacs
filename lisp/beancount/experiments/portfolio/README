This is an old script I used to use before I had a working export to a Google
Sheets document. It aggregated holdings against various features:

- ETF issuer
- Liquidity
- My employer's stock
- Asset class
- Currency/country exposure
- Taxable or non-taxable

Since then, I've replaced much of this by exporting to a spreadsheet and doing
the aggregations there. This allows me to access the most up-to-date information
from my phone during the day (not that I watch that closely, but I do observe
the total change once or twice/day while waiting for coffee).
