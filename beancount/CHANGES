========================
   beancount: CHANGES
========================
Note: This file contains only changes in the 'default' branch.


2017-01-26

  - (internal) Moved the implementation of booking methods to its own
    beancount.parser.booking_methods module.

  - (internal) Split up the booking methods to functions for exhaustive testing
    and allowing others to implement new methods more easily if desired.


2017-01-22

  - Added new price source fetcher from OANDA's API. It supports a large number
    of currency pairs with tickers like this "XXX_YYY", such as "EUR_USD". Use
    it like the other price sources, e.g., like this:

      bean-price -e 'USD:oanda/EUR_USD'


2017-01-21

  - Fixed #155: Use entry_points instead of scripts in setup.py.

  - Added an extra check for Balance directives, verifying that asserted
    currencies are accepted currencies for that account (if the account's
    corresponding currencies have been declared explicitly). In other words,
    this will now fail instead of being silently ignored:

      2017-01-21 open Assets:Checking    CAD
      2017-01-21 balance Assets:Checking  0.00 USD

  - Fixed bug in sheets_upload.py / upload-to-sheets whereby all the fields of a
    sheet being updated just in order to resize it was causing the sheet to be
    reindexed at the front of the list of sheets.

  - Merged 'arithmetic_ops' branch with no effect, in order to move all files
    and release. This will have to be revisited later.


2017-01-19

  - Fixed bug with generation of column names in sheets uploader script.


2017-01-16

  - Removed tools/gauth (used to be beancount.docs.gauth). All users of this are
    slightly different, and they're utility scripts. Unfactoring.

  - Removed beancount.docs from Beancount library. These are internal tools used
    to manage documentation, should not be included in the installed codebase.

  - Some cleanup of internal tools.

  - Added some basic unit tetsts for beancount.tools.sheets_upload.

  - Moved bin/upload-to-sheets to src/python/beancount/tools/sheets_upload.py
    and replaced it with an associated stub for it.

  - Moved bin/treeify to src/python/beancount/tools/treeify.py. The script is
    still usable in a standalone form (no new dependencies have been added). To
    have all the source code in one place is more convenient for maintenance.

  - Created a beancount.tools package to contain all standalone tools which
    don't depend on Beancount modules or packages.

  - Removed branch "returns2" and moved associated projects script
    beancount.projects.returns to experiments/returns. This code isn't robust
    enough to work for everyone, and so therefore I'm moving it back to
    experiments until I have time to produce something that will work very
    robustly, and on all my own accounts as well.


2017-01-15

  (from branch "conversions")

  - Created and test beancount.core.convert Posting and Position conversion
    functions: get_units(), get_cost(), get_weight(), get_value() (for market
    value).

  - Implemented Inventory.reduce() and associated test, which works in
    conjunction with those.

  - Implemented more straightforward versions of convert_position() and
    convert_amount() in module beancount.core.convert, to convert positions and
    amounts to other currencies.

  - Deprecated Inventory.units(); use Inventory.reduce(convert.get_units)

  - Deprecated Inventory.cost(); use Inventory.reduce(convert.get_cost)

  - Deprecated Inventory.get_units() to Inventory.get_currency_units() in order to
    avoid future name confusion.

  - Deprecated Position.at_cost(); use convert.get_cost(position) instead.

  - Deprecated Position.get_cost(); use convert.get_cost(position) instead.

  - Deprecated b.c.interpolation.compute_cost_basis(); use
    Inventory.(pos for pos in positions if pos.cost is not
    None).reduce(convert.get_cost)
    instead.

  - Deprecated get_posting_weight(); use convert.get_weight() instead.

  - Removed b.ops.holdings.get_pholding_market_value(), which was unused.
    If you need a market-value function, use convert.get_value() instead.

  - Converted all the old code to these new converted functions.

  - Moved module beancount.ops.prices to beancount.core.prices, and added a
    deprecation warning.

  - Deprecated shell function PRICE(). Renamed it to GETPRICE() in order to
    avoid confusion.

  - Removed beancount.core.prices.convert_amount(). Use
    beancount.core.convert.convert_amount() instead. Note that a failure doesn't
    return None anymore, but an unmodified amount. Also notice the reordering of
    parameters to be consistent with the other functions in that module.

  - Removed beancount.core.prices.get_position_market_value();
    use convert.get_value() instead.

  - Removed beancount.core.prices.get_inventory_market_value();
    use Inventory.reduce(convert.get_value, price_map) instead.

  - Removed private functions
      beancount.query.query_env.convert_amount(),
      beancount.query.query_env.convert_position(), and
      beancount.query.query_env.value_position(),
      beancount.query.query_env.value_inventory().
    These used to issue warnings if the conversion could not be carried out; now
    they simply keeps the units of the position instead.


2017-01-15

  - Fixed all tests for Python-3.6.
    Beancount has not officially been ported to Python-3.6.


2017-01-14

  - Fixed bug with generation of example that would produce an incorrect initial
    balance for banking accounts. The example test should have been broken. (No
    idea why this wasn't deteted earlier, probably by chance.)


2017-01-08

  - Completed "Intro to Double-Entry Accounting" doc.
    http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/intro

  - Added a --reverse/--descending flag to bean-extract to print the extracted
    entries in reverse order.


2016-12-17

  - Added a --title option to upload-to-sheets in order to conveniently set the
    document's title.

  - Removed obsolete variable LEGACY_DEFAULT_TOLERANCES which had been
    forgotten.


2016-12-15

  - Made beancount.ingest.extract print out a stack trace when an unexpected
    exception is raised.

  - Fixed bugs in beancount.query.query_render where expand wasn't being passed
    through the rendering functions.

  - Deprecated bin/upload-csv-to-google-sheet; I moved the last version to
    beancount/experiments/gapis in case you've come to be dependent on its
    particularities. It doesn't need any of the Beancount libraries, so you can
    just copy it somewhere and keep using it if so desired.

  - Replaced "bin/upload-csv-to-google-sheet" to "bin/upload-to-sheets". The
    newer script is a complete rewrite which does not require the antiquated
    gdata library, and which uses the latest and greatest version of the Google
    Sheets API (v4). You don't need gdata anymore. Moreover, this one runs in
    Python3 instead of depending on Python2.

    The script has slightly improved invocation semantics, and I'll using it
    regularly to share CSV files with others, most often CSV files produced by
    bean-query.


2016-12-11

  - Changed b.p.split_expenses outputs to be more useful.


2016-12-10

  - Made Amount, Posting, Cost and CostSpec all immutable classes that inherit
    from typing.NamedTuple.

  - Removed mutable method Posting.add().


2016-12-05

  - Merged changes made for calculating wash sales a long time ago. I had
    implemnted a temporary kludge to carry dates on all augmenting postings,
    left it in a branch so I could use it there for taxes every year. Now that
    the booking branch is merged, this is supported by default, so I could undo
    that kludge. Some changes remained:

    * The Inventory.add_amount() method used to return the modified position.
      Now it returns the position before being modified, which is more useful.

    * The list-wash-sales.py script has been updated. It now works on 'default'.

    * The 'carry_date_and_book_cost' branch has been merged away.


2016-12-04

  - Made .tags and .links attributes of b.data.Transaction and b.data.Document
    directives ensured to always be a set when they're empty. If there are no
    tags (or links), those attributes are set to b.data.EMPTY_SET, whose value
    is a frozenset(). This should make the processing of those attributes a bit
    simpler.

    Note that if you create transactions from plugins and their tags and/or
    links attributes are set None, they will now fail. The right thing to do is
    to set their value to an empty set, or reuse the immutable
    beancount.core.data.EMPTY_SET object.

    If you need to circumvent this temporarily, set the following option in your
    file, which will allow None again:

      option "allow_deprecated_none_for_tags_and_links" "TRUE"

    See {1989ba9e0e79} for details.

  - Updated all copyright and license notices on all files.

  - Added a script to automatically verify that all source files include a
    copyright notice.

  - Removed ancestral Beancount documentation from eons ago. These notes and
    conversationsa are now wildly irrelevant to the current state of Beancount,
    and all the documentation from Google Docs is vastly more recent and
    obsoletes all these old snippets and notes.

  - Moved all development tools under tools/, from etc/ and
    experiments/code-health/.


2016-12-03

  - Fixed fava bug #429, avoid empty conversion entries if the cost of the
    conversion balance is zero. See:
    https://github.com/beancount/fava/issues/429.


2016-11-20

  - Fixed bugs in bean-format; in order to do this properly I made bean-format
    reuse the globally defined regular expressions for currency and account in
    the rest of Beancount's code. This makes bean-format depend on the Beancount
    installation. Bah, it's reasonable. This issue is related to issue #146.

  - Added ANY_META() function to the SQL shell's environment; ANY_META() allows
    you to query a posting's metadata, falling back on the parent entry's
    metadata. This idea was suggested by Stefano Zacchiroli in
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beancount/jh-n4rvbQAI/Hz5Mmd60BAAJ. I also
    added the first unit tests for environment functions--I'll have to write all
    of those at some point.

  - Made unsupported cost specifications in the SIMPLE booking algorithm issue
    an appropriate error. For example, instead of just ignoring the cost spec in
    this:

          2014-10-15 * "buy widgets"
            Assets:Inventory     10 WIDGET {} ;; Not supported.
            Assets:Cash         -80 GBP

    It will issue an error. See
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beancount/9NBcT-SXZMQ/sy7Z3dIdBQAJ for
    context.


2016-11-12

  - Made the Emacs prefix key configurable via a new beancount-mode-map-prefix
    variable. See discussion here:
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beancount/_7TscZ9phNE/K8PkcRMpBAAJ


2016-11-06

  - Fixed #139: Full booking parsing had been more liberal than the old SIMPLE
    booking algorithm can interpret. In the old code, explicitly disallow some
    interpolation cases which cannot be handled.

  - Fixed #129: Ignore custom directives for Ledger and HLedger conversion.


2016-11-05

  - Fixed #142: bean-check should return non-zero exit code upon failure.


2016-10-30

  - Merge the current version of the 'booking' branch and made the "FULL" booking
    algorithm the default one.

    * The "experiment_booking_algorithm" option has been renamed to
      "booking_algorithm". Its default value is now "FULL"; everyone will be
      using the new booking code. If for some reason you have a transitional
      need to revert to the older booking method use this option.

        option "booking_algorithm" "SIMPLE"

    * The new booking algorithm is _MUCH_ more powerful than the one old. I'll
      describe it soon in a new document, but briefly:

      - It supports many more interpolation capabilities; try omitting amounts
        or currencies which you think it ought be able to figure out
        automatically and you might find it does.

      - All positions carry a date. This means that if you have transactions
        that would merge because they weren't specified with a date, like this
        you may face a problem:

          2016-01-15 *
            Assets:Investments          70 UUG {10.00 USD}
            ...

          2016-02-16 *
            Assets:Investments          25 UUG {10.00 USD}
            ...

          2016-03-30 *
            Assets:Investments         -80 UUG {10.00 USD}
            ...

        Those used to resolve automatically because both augmenting lots would
        merge into a single one without a date. Now that all positions have an
        acquisition date, the -80 reducing posting is ambiguous, because it
        matches against these:

            Assets:Investments          70 UUG {10.00 USD, 2016-01-15}
            Assets:Investments          25 UUG {10.00 USD, 2016-02-16}

        Either you'll have to disambiguate, or let Beancount do so. One way to
        do this is to add more specific matching data, and split the posting.
        An even easier way to do this is to make the default booking method of
        this account to "FIFO" or "LIFO", which will automatically select the
        oldest (newest) postings without issuing a warning.

        If you find yourself in a bind, please email the mailing-list with a
        specific and as small as possible data input that reproduces the
        problem.


  - Removed parsing of the pipe (|) symbol as a separator for strings on
    transaction description lines. This was vestigial from the days long long
    ago when Beancount was attempting to be compatible with Ledger syntax; this
    is wholly unnecessary how.

    You will have to convert transactions like this:

      2015-08-25 * "Tunnel" | "Coffees"
        Expenses:Food:Coffee           15 CAD
        Assets:Cash

    Into transactions like this:

      2015-08-25 * "Tunnel" "Coffees"
        Expenses:Food:Coffee           15 CAD
        Assets:Cash

    This can be done using a sed script, or as a macro in your favorite text editor.
    If you need a temporary respite, you can use the following option, which
    will replace all the error messages by a single warning:

      option "allow_pipe_separator" "TRUE"

    Support for this option will be removed eventually.


  - Moved the {{...}}} total cost syntax from a legacy support with only "/"
    separator and a date, no label, to full support. Previously, only these syntaxes
    were supported for total cost:

      Assets:Account     100 MSFT {{2000.00 USD}}
      Assets:Account     100 MSFT {{2000.00 USD / 2016-10-30}}

    Changes:

    * The "/" separator support has been removed, you must now use a comma, like
      for the {...} full booking syntax.

    * The same syntax as for the regular {...} compound cost is supported;
      however, specifying a compound amount will raise an error, and the
      per-unit cost is interpreted as a total cost.

    For example, this:

      Assets:Account     100 MSFT {{2000.00 USD}}

    is interpreted as:

      Assets:Account     100 MSFT {0 # 2000.00 USD}

    which is equivalent to:

      Assets:Account     100 MSFT {20.00 USD}

    And the following will raise an error, it is not legal syntax:

      Assets:Account     100 MSFT {{0 # 2000.00 USD}}

    Finally, specifying a date and a label can be done, just like for {...}:

      Assets:Account     100 MSFT {{2000.00 USD, 2011-10-30, "ref32"}}

    The intention here is to deprecate the older limited syntax while keeping
    support for total cost input using {{...}}. Based on previous questions, I
    suspect that many users are still using {{...}} instead of {{# ...}}, so I
    won't remove it just yet.

  - Removed very old compatibility code in beancount.core.amount that lived
    since I cleaned up the definition of the D() constructor and moved it to
    beancount.core.number.

  - Removed built-in aliases for auto_accounts and implicit_prices modules, from
    beancount.ops to beancount.plugins.

  - Removed deprecated option "default_tolerance" (which had been renamed to
    "inferred_tolerance_default").

  - Removed deprecated option "tolerance".

  - Remove deprecated use of 'plugin' as an option. The directive ought to be
    the only way.

  - Removed deprecated option "experiment_explicit_tolerances".

  - Renamed "experiment_booking_algorithm" to "booking_algorithm", and changed
    the default value to "FULL". The old "SIMPLE" algorithm will be deprecated
    eventually.

  - Removed old code that would warn if the user set account_rounding to a full
    account name; it just needs be a subaccount.

  - Commit to Python 3.5. 3.5.0 released more than a year ago. You need to
    update or stick with the 2.0b13 release.

  - Remove old code to dispatch between an external Enum class and the built-in
    one that's included in 3.5 (commit to 3.5).

  - Added type annotations to beancount.core.data. This will grow more over
    time. (I also need to add rules to use those.)


2016-10-23

  - Modified parsing of transaction strings and links and tags. I did this to
    factor out the parsing of tags and links in order to add it to other
    transactions and minimize grammar code. There is user-visible impact to this
    change: all of a transaction's strings must appear before tags or links. You
    cannot place tags or links before or in-between strings anymore. This is a
    reasonable restriction and I doubt anybody did anyway.

  - Added support for tags and links to the Document directive. This works just
    as for Transactions, e.g.

      2016-10-23 document Assets:Checking "/statements/oct.pdf" #banking ^9fed846348c2

    The current tags on the tag stack are also included, like for transactions.


2016-10-10

  - Removed "experiment_explicit_tolerances" flag; made this supported by
    default permanently.


2016-10-08

  - Documented a subtle problem reported about balances against inventory of
    mixed at-cost and no-cost, added more context to the error and a unit test
    for balance checks with mixed at-cost and no-cost positions.

  - Fixed a bug in the full booking matching code whereby an existing position
    not held at cost would trip up the matching code. (Credits to Son Nguyen for
    finding and reporting.)

  - During ingest, when multiple extractors match a particular file, select the
    first matching account instead of raising an error.

  - Fixed accidentally colliding key-binding for invoking bean-price from Emacs,
    to C-c p.


2016-09-25

  - Fixed typo in grammar that was parsing a transaction flag as '#' into '*'.

  - Added "cost_date" and "cost_label" columns in the SQL shell.


2016-09-04

  - Implemented new "run" shell command that allows you to run a named query.
    For example, if an input file has a Query directive like this:

      2016-09-01 query "home" "select account, sum(position) where account ~ 'Home' group by 1"

    And you input this command:

      run home

    The entries will be closed at tue query date (2016-09-01) and the query
    automatically run. If you want to always include all the transactions, set a
    date far into the future.

    This works from the command-line and from the shell, equally. You can also
    run all the queries in an input file, like this:

      run *

    To view the list of available queries, just type the "run" command without
    an argument.


2016-08-21

  - Fixed a SQL shell bug with extracting UNITS() from a Position column.

  - Finally properly fixed the timezone of the Google Finance price fetcher.
    (It was done incorrectly and I found my unit tests failing whenever I would
    work on Beancount from another timezone.)


2016-08-17

  - Added beancount.core.amount.abs() function for absolute values of Amount.

  - Added rendering of links to beancount.plugins.split_expenses plugin, and
    made it quiet by default. Added --output-stdout option to make it do that
    again.

  - Created a new experimental script that attempts to match postings between
    two ledgers. A pair of (filename, account-regexp) is provided for each, and
    then the amounts and links are compared and paired up, and remaining
    unmatched postings are printed out. This is very useful to reconcile trip
    expenses between a personal ledger and the ledger for a trip or external
    project where some of the expenses are paid from the personal ledger as
    contributions to the trip or project.

  - Made the upload-csv-to-google-sheet script use the basename (without
    extension) of the given filenames as sheet names instead of "Sheet X"
    numbers. (Note: This entire thing be rewritten using the new Google Sheets
    API which won't require gdata and which will be more stable.)

  - Added a quick implementation of b.q.query_render.render_csv()
    and refactored b.q.query_render.render_text() to use common code. Both
    functions now have a new 'expand' option which will create multiple rows for
    cells which return a list of strings. The new default behavior is to
    concatenate the strings with commas.

    The shell (bean-query) has a new 'expand' shell variable to match. Also, the
    -f/--format option of it is now supported, and in interactive mode it sets
    the default value for 'expand'.

  - Since output to CSV is now implemented, I enabled the --output-csv option of
    b.p.split_expenses as well.


2016-08-14

  - Fixed bug in beancount.utils.file_type for Python3, whereby magic now returns
    bytes, not a string


2016-08-04

  - Made account name components allowed to have two characters (beyond the
    first component). For instance, Assets:Investments:F is now a valid account
    name.


2016-07-11

  - Added parsing a transaction date column to metadata in the CSV importer.


2016-07-01

  - bean-format now accepts input from stdin.


2016-06-30

  - Make it possible for a BALANCES statement to have a WHERE clause. BALANCES
    is now equivalent to

      SELECT account, sum(position) FROM ... WHERE ... GROUP BY account

    Inching one step closer to removing that WHERE clause eventually.


2016-06-18

  - Added support for columns AMOUNT_DEBIT and AMOUNT_CREDIT in the csv
    importer.

  - Merged ongoing progress from 'booking' branch; if you don't use any of the
    in-progress new booking methods, this should not have any effect.

    However, the 'booking_method has changed names and you may have to adjust
    its values if you've been tinkering with it:

    * 'booking_method' used to take on value "SIMPLE" or "FULL" and dispatch
      betwee the current (old) booking implementation and the new one which will
      support many other booking methods. This option is now named
      'experiment_booking_algorithm' (a new option) and takes on the same
      values. The default value is "SIMPLE", which keeps the behavior unchanged.
      Use "FULL" if you want to test out the new booking algorithm: the new
      algorithms should work except for the AVERAGE cost method. WARNING: This
      is still under flux and considered unreleased.

    " 'booking_method': This is a different option now, and takes the value of
      any one of the booking methods visible here:
      https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/7b9e00e6e19136f680befc1d4322f47cdc294cf6/src/python/beancount/core/data.py?at=booking&fileviewer=file-view-default#data.py-64


2016-06-13

  - Ported beancount.docs.download_docs to the v3 drive API and the use of a
    service account instead of a full access to a user account. Service accounts
    are easier to configure and work with.

  - Ported beancount.docs.upload_options to the v3 drive API.


2016-06-05

  - Added a new column to the posting context: "other_accounts" is a set of
    account strings for the other postings of the transaction.

  - Added a new JOINSTR() generic function to the shell, to reduce the repeated
    column above to a single comma-separated string.


2016-05-28

  - Made various changes to the shell in order to make it possible to convert to
    the market value:

    * CONVERT() has been converted to convert to the market value, when applied
      to a position held at cost. However, it still requires a target currency
      and it may fail if you apply it to a position for which the cost currency
      differs from that of the target currency, i.e., it will not automatically
      chase down the transitive conversions toward the desired target currency.

    * A new function VALUE() has been added, which is similar to CONVERT() but
      which when applied to a position held at cost converts to the cost
      currency at the current price. It's similar to CONVERT() but you don't
      have to provide the target currency. And similarly to CONVERT(), you may
      provide a particular date, and if at that date there is no available
      conversion rate in the prices database, the conversion will fail
      analogously and spit out an error message.

    * PRICE() has been renamed to GETPRICE() to avoid some confusion. PRICE()
      does not convert, it merely gets the price from the price database.
      GETPRICE() is thus a more appropriate name.

  - Created the beancount.plugins.mark_unverified plugin as a response to this
    thread: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beancount/hQoOSJE7qNo/-E__v-XhEgAJ

    This plugin makes it possible to compute the balances as of the last Balance
    directive of each account by adding metadata to postings which appear after
    that account's last balance. You'd filter out unverified postings with an SQL
    query on meta-data like this:

      SELECT account, sum(position)
      WHERE NOT meta('unverified')
      GROUP BY 1
      ORDER BY 1

    Note that the resulting balanaces almost certainly don't sum up to zero,
    because of differing dates of the Balance directives. Also, note that
    accounts without a single Balance directive will not have their postings
    marked at all.


2016-05-08

  - In the output of bean-price, sort prices exclusively by currency, regardless
    of date. This is because on weekends you'll tend to get slightly varying
    dates, and manual/occasional price updates are usually put in "chunks" in a
    file section. It's easier to visually find the price by scanning by currency
    order.


2016-05-05

  - Added a shell function to filter a set of strings (for tags or links) with a
    regular expression and return the first one. This way you can extract some
    of the tags or links with a pattern as columns.


2016-05-01

  - Fixed issue #124, a leak in the grammar parser which would leak the entire
    set of entries on every instance of parse.

  - Fixed some warnings about unclosed files which occur only on default python
    branch.


2016-04-29

  - Don't just log an extraction error to logging.error() in the regression
    tests; let the exception through. This makes building and debugging
    importers much easier.

  - Created an experimental script to extract date/location information required
    for a naturalization application.


2016-04-24

  - Rewrote the section on "Core Data Structures" of the Design Doc, to reflect
    the newer internals of Beancount, those which have been merged from the
    ongoing 'booking' branch.
    See http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/design-doc.


2016-04-23

  - Added beancount.ingest.importers.fileonly, a simplistic importer which can
    be instantiated to just file away some downloads without extracting anything
    from them.


2016-04-18

  - In bean-doctor context, all the accounts should appear in the
    post-transaction balances, even if their balance is empty. This had been
    fixed for the pre-transaction balances but I stumbled upon a case of
    post-transaction balances not showing an empty account.


2016-04-17

  - Added support for the BEANCOUNT_LOAD_CACHE_FILENAME environment variable,
    which can be set in order to overridde the location of the pickle cache.
    This variable may contain the string "{filename}", and if it is present the
    basename of the beancount file will be spliced in. This can be useful if,
    for example, you are reading your Beancount input file from a read-only
    filesystem and still want to use the cache by specifying an alternative
    filename.

  - Fixed a bug when reading from a read-only filesystem, the loader cache would
    fail to be removed and raise an exception.

  - Fixed an important bug in beancount.ingest whereby instances of
    b.i.cache.FileMemo weren't being shared as widely as they could have been.
    FileMemo instances now have to be created via b.i.cache.get_file() and
    FileMemo is now a hidden class _FileMemo. See this discussion for more details:
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beancount/b-ZqYqag7AU/N-AaGSZOAwAJ


2016-04-10

  - Create a new 'beancount.plugins.fix_payees' plugin that allows the user to
    provide a set of rules to rewrite and clean up the names of the payees from
    the Beancount file.

    While it would be ideal to do this at import time, in practice there are a
    lot of downloaded files' "memo" fields which get set as the payee
    automatically. These "memos" aren't very clean and readable strings: they
    sometimes contain numbers, partial city names, and other junk. In order to
    produce clean reports where one might want to aggregate by payee, it's
    useful to rewrite the payees to make them nice and clean. You can use this
    plugin to do that.


  - Made the Custom directive accept ACCOUNT tokens. You can now do something
    like this:

      2014-06-20 custom "budget" Assets:Account2 "balance < 200.00 USD"

    Prior to this, the account name had to be represented as a string. (Users of
    the burgeoning Custom directive not like this very much.)

    Note that account names and regular strings are both output from the parser
    as 'str' objects, so in order to make this possible, I had to change the
    representation of the values to a pair of (value, dtype). Account names have
    a 'dtype' of beancount.core.account.TYPE. (Eventually I will probably want
    to make account strings represented with their own custom datatypes, but
    that will require a fair amount of work on the codebase; this substitute is
    fine for now, as there are no other places where such a disambiguation is
    necessary.)


2016-04-04

  - Added a test to make sure that building a source dist includes the header
    files and C implementation files.

  - Sort Document directives after Transactions when they occur on the same day.
    The reason for this is that statements typically include transactions on
    that final day, and we'd like for them to occur at the right place in the
    journals. See originating thread:
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beancount/3ItOYS9DJx4/VyTJB3ssBQAJ


2016-04-03

  - Fixed a bug in "bean-doctor context" which wouldn't report the full set of
    accounts when an account's before-balance would be empty.

  - Fixed a bug in "bean-doctor linked" whereby the balances wouldn't get
    printed out if there was no link. Print the balances before and after; in
    fact, maybe this command should be renamed to "balances" and have an option
    to support links.


2016-03-31

  - Added TODAY() function to extract today's date. Not sure how useful it'll
    be.


2016-03-27

  - Added a PRICE() function to extract entries from the price database. You can
    now query for "SELECT PRICE('USD', 'CAD', date)", for example.

  - Added a boolean renderer for the SQL shell.

  - Added support for arithmetic operations to the bean-query SQL shell.


2016-03-26

  - Added an optional date argument to convert, so you can provide the requested
    date in a SQL query, as in "CONVERT(sum(position), "CAD", 2015-06-01)".

  - Improved the rendering of the context, removed the weird comments it used to
    render with, render an account name if the inventory is empty.

  - Ignore .DS_Store files from the file finder in ingest.


2016-03-22

  - Support multiple accounts in same ofx file. See
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/pull-requests/10/. I applied this
    one-liner: issue a balance for each statement, use the maximum date for the
    file_date() method, and added unit tests for this.


2016-03-21

  - Fixed bug in beancount.ingest.file whereby two files being filed to the same
    destination filename would clobber each other; with this fix, instead, an
    error will be generated.

  - Create an example of an importer just filing a PDF file using the external
    tool PDFminer2. If the tool isn't installed, nothing should "break" (but the
    importer won't really do its job). The tests should be skipped
    automatically, and the importing will just ignore the PDF file to be filed.


2016-03-20

  - Implemented beancount.ingest.importers.regexp and
    beancount.ingest.importers.config mixin classes to help support
    functionality which used to be available in LedgerHub.

  - Removed the temporary beancount.ingest.importers.compat
    backwards-compatibility helper for LedgerHub. Not needed.

  - Completed the documentation for the new import framework "beancount.ingest".
    The document is here:
    http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/ingest


2016-03-19

  - Centralized the <3.4 and >=3.4 support for Enum class into
    beancount.utils.misc_utils.Enum.

  - Added an option to the OFX importer to let the instantiator decides whether
    a balance directive should not be inserted (NONE), should be inserted at the
    declared date of a <ledgerbal> tag (DECLARED), or right after the last entry
    imported from the file (LAST).


2016-03-18

  - Merged 'web_months' branch modified from changes originally submitted by
    Dave Stephens, which implements a monthly view. You enter the monthly view
    from the annual view.


2016-03-14

  - Added META() and ENTRY_META() functions to the SQL shell to answer a
    question on the mailing-list (from richieuk63 at gmail dot com).

  - Fixed a bug with the OFX importer whereby the Balance directive should be
    generated to a day following the date provided in the LEDGERBAL directive.

  - Added forgotten dependency on "beautifulsoup4" in setup.py.


2016-03-13

  - Merged more changes from the 'ingest' branch which furthers the work of
    integrating the LedgerHub code into Beancount (almost done now).

    * Added mimetype() and head() methods to the file cache object passed to the
      extractors, as a convenience instead of having clients call the cached
      convert() method.

    * Added paranoid exception handlers to all the methods called on the
      importer classes.

    * Added tests for the examples provided in "examples/ingest".

    * Refactor some of the code of beancount.ingest.file.

    * Fixed bugs with ensuring the filenames are absolute names.

    * Cleaned up the output of the commands.

    * Made the header and section strings configurable from the import
      configuration.

    * Cleaned up the OFX importer from LedgerHub, added unit tests for it, and
      added it to the beancount.ingest.importers directory. In addition, added
      it to the example configuration for ingest under
      beancount/examples/ingest.

    * Added a dependency on the beautifulsoup4 package (bs4) in order to parse
      XML files.

  - Added a beancount.core.amount.add() function to add two amounts.

  - Made the directive printer be more lenient to support incomplete postings.

  - Moved the "src/clojure" and "src/golang" directories to the experiments/
    directory; they really are experiments. Should have done this a long time
    ago.


2016-03-12

  - Converted the amount.amount_*() functions to amount.*(). It's just simpler
    and nicer.

  - Made the beancount.report.balance_reports text reports rendered using the
    precision from the DisplayContext, and realization.dump_balances() require a
    formatter argument. More probaby needs to be done on issue #108 to close it,
    but that's a good start.

  - Made the beancount.plugins.auto_accounts plugin insert entries that will
    sort stably.

  - Sync up the print report code with the print command code, fixing a bug with
    precision not being rendered correctly by the print report.

  - Fixed #104: bean-format would fail on numbers with commas in them.

  - Fixed #106: The "render_commas" option wasn't being honored. I have no idea
    how things came to be this way, but I fixed it. When rendering numbers,
    inserting commas for thousands (e.g., "1,000" vs. "1000") is now controlled
    by the "render_commas" option, and the default is not to render them
    (FALSE). Note:  This should affect the web interface, the reports, and the
    PRINT command, but so far NOT the output of the SQL query reports. The
    reason for this is historical: the query rendering code does not make use of
    the DisplayContext; it needs to be converted to do that. See
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/issues/105/
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/issues/106/
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/issues/107/ and
    https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beancount/frfN1zc6TEc/d5OjuDnREgAJ for a
    discussion.


2016-03-06

  - Fixed issue #83: Renamed 'default_tolerance' option to
    'inferred_tolerance_default'.

  - Added exception handlers for all importer callbacks. Badly written importers
    should never completely throw off the tools.


2016-03-05

  - Improved handling of corrupted or out-of-date pickle cache file.

  - Fixed a test that would only fail in a timzone != EST.

  - Made bean-file use the configuration filename's directory as the default
    output dir instead of requiring an option. The behavior of providing a
    reasonable default makes most sense.


2016-02-28

  - Moved beancount.scripts.report to beancount.report.report in order to be
    consistent with the way other libraries are invoked. I had to move
    beancount.report.report out of the way (to beancount.report.base) to make
    space for it.

  - Moved beancount.scripts.query to beancount.query.shell in order to be
    consistent with the way other libraries are invoked.

  - Merged fix by yagebu for bug found in b.ops.summarize() that would not yield
    a list of ordered transactions.

  - Introduced a new "Custom" directive type. You can enter directives like
    this:

      2016-02-28 custom "budget" ....

    where "..." can be a mixed list of

    * string
    * date
    * boolean
    * number
    * amount (number + currency)

    The first element is a string, which is intended to be used as the runtime
    type of the directive. This can be used to prototype new features in plugins
    or otherwise.

    Right now, no consistency is enforced on the datatypes declared for
    directives with the same type name. Also, there is currently no way for a
    plugin to declare what a valid set of tokens may be (but I may do this later
    on to simplify error reporting for plugin implementors).


2016-02-27

  - Fixed rendering bug in bean-web whereby empty cells would receive a 0.00
    amount.

  - Improved rendering of the account name in the name of the compat importer.


2016-02-24

  - Changed the bean-doctor "linked" command to fetch the set of links from the
    entire set of entries.

  - Added ABS() function to the shell, in order to dig around for transactions
    with a particular amount.


2016-02-22

  - Fixed issue #98: There was a bug when fetching historical data from a Yahoo
    price source was failing, it wasn't handled correctly.

  - Merged LedgerHub back into beancount under a new "beancount.ingest" package.
    The new protocol for importers can be read at:
    /home/blais/p/repos/beancount1/src/python/beancount/ingest/importer.py

    There are three new scripts:

      bean-identify
      bean-extract
      bean-file

    These correspond one-to-one to their ledgerhub variants.

    There is a bit more work to be done to complete this - see the top of the
    TODO file in the "ingest" branch if you're interested - and I'll write
    documentation on this once all the work is completed.

    LedgerHub is now officially dead.


2016-02-20

  - Create an beancount.utils.misc_utils.is_sorted() utility function to be used
    in the new importer code.

  - Match a price source over the entire source string.


2016-02-19

  - Now accepting '=' in currency symbol in order to accommodate currencies in
    Yahoo, which look like this "CNYUSD=X".


2016-02-15

  - Handle an incomplete pickle file by ignoring it and regenerating it silently.


2016-02-14

  - Baked a 2.0b5 and 2.0b6 releases in a further attempt to get the included
    files to be included by setuptools and for pip3 to be able to make a local
    build. setuptools is horrible.

  - Baked a 2.0b4 release for a more recent PyPI availability.

  - Fixed issue #72 - Thanks to Gary Peck for figuring out what was wrong with
    setuptools - and now you should be able to install via pip3 again, which
    will pull all the dependencies automatically. If setuptools isn't installed,
    this should degrade peacefully to distutil.


2016-02-06

  - IMPORTANT API CHANGES FOLLOW:

    I made some important changes to the following classes:

      beancount.core.position.Position
      beancount.core.inventory.Inventory
      beancount.core.data.Posting

    "Position" objects have been restructured to reflect the structure implied
    by the syntax. Instead of a .number (Decimal) and .lot (Lot) objects, a
    Position now has a .units (Amount) and .cost (Cost) objects.

    The "Lot" class has been removed; it has been replaced by a "Cost" class
    with .number (Decimal), .currency (string), .date (datetime.date), .label
    (string) attributes.

    The "Inventory" class is a  list of "Position" objects, and as such it has
    received corresponding adjustments and minor changes.

    "Posting" objects do not contain a .position attribute anymore. Instead, the
    data structure has been flattened to contain .units and .cost objects
    directly. As a result, a Posting acts a bit like a subclass of a Position
    rather than using composition to contain one.

    During the parsing phase, a "Posting" object's .cost attribute does not
    point to a "Cost" instance, but rather to a "CostSpec" instance, which
    reflects the unresolved and partially incomplete lot specification from the
    input syntax that needs to get resolved to a particular lot during the new
    booking process.

    Here's a pictorial representation of changes. Before we had:

     Assets:Checking    -40    QQQ       {66.32 USD, 2015-12-14} @ 70.32 USD
     `---account---'  `number' `--------------lot--------------' `--price--'
                               `currency'`---cost--' `--date--'

        posting                     (Posting)
            .account                (str)
            .position               (Position)
                .number             (Decimal)
                .lot                (Lot)
                    .currency       (str)
                    .cost           (Amount)
                        .number     (Decimal)
                        .currency   (str)
                    .lot_date       (datetime.date)
            .price                  (Amount)
                .number             (Decimal)
                .currency           (str)


    After the changes we have something that looks more like the input:

     Assets:Checking  -40 QQQ   {66.32 USD,   2015-12-14, "0d6f0"} @ 70.32 USD
     `---account---' `-units-' `------------cost-----------------' `--price--'
                                number currency date       label

        posting             (Posting)
            .account        (str)
            .units          (Amount)
                .number     (Decimal)
                .currency   (str)
            .cost           (Cost, CostSpec, or None)
                .number     (Decimal)
                .currency   (str)
                .date       (datetime.date, or None)
                .label      (str, or None)
            .price          (Amount, or None)
                .number     (Decimal)
                .currency   (str)

    And field-by-field conversions:

        posting.account                    -> posting.account
        posting.position.number            -> posting.units.number
        posting.position.lot.currency      -> posting.units.currency
        posting.position.lot.cost.number   -> posting.cost.number
        posting.position.lot.cost.currency -> posting.cost.currency
        posting.position.lot.lot_date      -> posting.cost.date
        (none)                             -> posting.cost.label
        posting.price.number               -> posting.price.number
        posting.price.currency             -> posting.price.currency

    Notes:

    * These changes are mostly driven by the need for the parser to output
      incomplete cost specifications. The booking of lots against existing
      inventory is isolated in a beancount.parser.booking and before booking we
      need to be able to represent missing values from the input syntax, since
      the booking process is able to interpolate and fill in these missing
      values. It was required to make important changes to the data structures
      for this reason. The parser outputs 'posting.cost' with an instance of a
      new "CostSpec" class, not "Cost". After booking, all the postings's costs
      are replaced by instances of "Cost" and "CostSpec" is gone.

    * This representation is much closer to the syntax. It's also flatter and
      simpler. The original representation's design was driven by an old idea
      that the lots were to be used as the key in Inventory mappings, but as it
      turns out, operations on lots are just as well implemented with an
      association list and performance isn't a problem. Moreover, lots with a
      cost are never merged using such a mapping, only reduced against, so this
      was an unnecessary distraction.

    * If you were creating Position objects in plugins or other code, please
      look at the new interface and make necessary changes to your code. You can
      create new Position objects from a pair of Amount and Cost objects.


  - beancount.core.position.lot_currency_pair() has been converted to
    beancount.core.position.Position.currency_pair().

  - Renamed beancount.core.position.Position.cost() to
    beancount.core.position.Position.at_cost() due to the conflict resulting
    from the Position class changes.

  - There is a new option "booking_method" which should be set to the value
    "SIMPLE" to maintain the current booking algorithm (it's the default if left
    unset), but which can be set to "FULL" to enable the yet-unreleased, new
    experimental booking method. Do this at your own risk; this is not ready for
    public use, not effectively working yet.


2016-02-05

  - Fixed bug with query parser: a single dot (.) would be matched as a number.
    It should require at least some digits.

  - Fixed bug whereby a missing cost number would be rendered as "0"; if needs
    be a null value.


2016-01-31

  - Added python-magic as an optional depdendency, in order to support imports
    code. Updated http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/install

  - Renamed beancount.scripts.checkdeps to beancount.scripts.deps (annoyed with
    name too similar to beancount.scripts.check and I trip over it all the
    time).

  - Moved ledgerhub.core.compress to beancount.ops.compress and its associated
    test.

  - Moved ledgerhub.identify.filetype to beancount.utils.file_type and its
    associated test and test files.

  - Small improvement to beancount.utils.test_utils.skipIfRaises() to accept
    multiple exceptions.


2016-01-25

  - Moved many of the utility code from ledgerhub.utils to beancount.utils. This
    is beginning the process of migrating and rewriting LedgerHub and
    integrating it into the Beancount source code.

  - Moved the 'remove_crdb' utility script from LedgerHub into
    beancount/experiments/imports.


2016-01-18

  - Committed the Query directive to non-experimental status, for
    beancount-web's usage.


2016-01-16

  - Created the beancount.plugins.coherent_cost plugin which checks that one's
    currencies are either always used with cost, or never at all. This is by far
    the most typical situation whereby a currency is always held at cost, or
    never (and perhaps converted at price or not).

  - Created a function to filter just the transactions, which is such an
    incredibly common operation I should have done this a while ago. I should
    convert all code to use it.


2016-01-16

  - Added a feature to the "beancount.plugins.ira_contribs" plugin to allow the
    further restriction that the trigger posting must include a particular flag
    in order for the insertion to occur. This is to be used in account that have
    sales, whereby just looking at the sign of the posting isn't enough to
    decide that an insertion must be made.


2016-01-10

  - Addressed issue #96, supporting an explicitly installed C decimal version
    when the Python3 installation does not include one. From
    beancount.core.number:

      Note: Python 3.3 is supposed to guarantee a fast "C" decimal implementation,
      as it comes with its source code. However, in practice, many distributions,
      including the popular Ubuntu distro, simply don't compile it. Other distros
      (e.g., Arch Linux) insist on breaking up Python into multiple packages in
      order to manage the dependency to the mpdec library, and make that
      installation optional. Moreover, there seems to have been changes in the
      dispatching of pure-Python and fast C decimal implementations in Python-3.5's
      source code itself. The result is that despite Python-3.3 or above being
      installed, a fast C decimal implementation may or may not be present. Thus, we
      must detect it here. I believe this subtle problem should go away with
      Python-3.5 and above.

      What do we do? We import the default 'decimal' module, and if it's the pure
      Python implementation, we attempt to import an explicitly installed
      'cdecimal', which you can install with

        pip3 install m3-cdecimal

    Also added a check for this in checkdeps. Hopefully this resolves the issue
    once and for all.


2016-01-09

  - Fixed a bug (issue #94) in the load cache that wouldn't handle files
    disappearing after having been moved.


2016-01-03

  - Moved beancount.web.scrape.scrape() to beancount.web.web.scrape_webapp() to
    isolate beancount.web.scrape from dependencies, so that other projects may
    reuse it.


2015-12-25

  - Closed multiple obsolete branches: parse_test_utils, display_context,
    performance, datatypes.

  - Added some utilities for parsing strings for writing tests that use the
    local variables present in the caller (a bit of magic).

  - Improved date parsing from command-line options for some scripts; imported
    from branch 'text_statements'.


2015-12-24

  - Implemented metadata stack and "pushmeta" and "popmeta" directives mirroring
    "pushtag" and "poptag". These new directives work similarly, but setting
    metadata fields instead of tags themselves. The parser maintains a stack of
    values for each metadata field. Values explicitly set on the Transactions
    themselves are not overridden by the meta stack.


2015-12-21

  - Created a new project script that uses specific metadata on Open directives
    to generate a document of a user's assets, institution names, addresses and
    contact info, and account types and approximate value. Note: I haven't made
    the example file include necessary fields to demo or document this yet.

  - The loader now supports loading encrypted files transparently. If a filename
    ends with .gpg or .asc (and contains armored content), the file is run
    through a gpg subprocess to decrypt it. No temporary files are created. Note
    that caching for those files is disabled.

    If you're writing a script, you can also call
    beancount.loaded.load_encrypted_file() directly to avoid the check.

  - Implemented the 'beancount.plugins.merge_meta' plugin that copies metadata
    from an external file into a regular file. It is essentially a data join on
    the key of accounts for Open and Close directives, and a join on the key of
    currency on Commodity directives.

  - Added an option to Inventory.to_string() to avoid rendering parentheses.

  - Added variable and username expansion support for the loader filename.

  - Removed --batch mode for the encryption support; it needs to be potentially
    interactive.


2015-12-17

  - In prices, removed undocumented support for automatically extracting
    Commodities with a "quote" metadata field. This had been used in times past
    and had been brought in as legacy, but now neither the export code nor the prices
    code use it. Vaccummed away.


2015-12-13

  - Fixed a minor bug with the loader cache whereby errors weren't getting
    emitted on a cache hit (Issue #92).


2015-12-12

  - Made bean-web's --incognito mode replace integer numbers, not just
    fractional ones. (See issue #86).

  - Output a warning when cdecimal isn't installed. This may occur on some
    distribution which break up Python into multiple packages in order to allow
    the user to avoid depending on a mpdec library install. Arch Linux suffers
    from this problem.

  - Made some improvements to the loader caching algorithm in order not to rely
    on the percision of timestamps from the filesystem. Filesystems implement
    one-second precision which is not sufficient in some case. I now cache both
    the time and the size of files in order to check for a cache hit, and this
    paves the way for hashing the contents of files as well eventually.

  - Began implementing aggregation of some of the attributes of options map
    across include files. Both "operating_currency" and "commodities" will be
    aggregated correctly. (This was a request for beancount-web.)

  - Fixed flaky test that failed only in homecooked install of Python 3.5.1.

  - Fixed a minor bug that would not print out costs with zero amounts.


2015-12-11

  - In the context page dedicated to rendering the details of an entry, render
    an "Open" link on the upper right that can be clicked on in order to invoke
    a desktop handler that will open a text editor to the containing file and at
    the right line number.


2015-12-10

  - Renamed beancount.reports.context.render_entry_context() to
    render_file_context() and implemented render_entry_context() to accept an
    entry directly instead of a (filename, line-no), so that bug reporters can
    insert some print statements. I also removed the dcontext instance required
    to be passed, since all the callers were fetching it from options_map. This
    should make it easier for those sending bug reports to insert quick calls to
    render the context around a particular entry or file location.


2015-12-09

  - Fixed installation snafu: forgot to add the beancount.prices and bean-price
    install to the setup.py file.


2015-12-07

  - Fixed a bug in the load cache, whereby the load cache would not update
    itself on an included file. In order to do this, first I made the loader
    always return the full correct set of unique filenames processed in a load
    call, and then I used this to check the latest modified time.

  - I also used this to fix a related bug in the bean-web watcher: If an
    included file was being modified, bean-web would not reload itself
    automatically. redstreet0 sent a pull request to highlight the problem
    (thanks!):
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/pull-requests/6/feature-include-files-refresh/diff


2015-12-03

  - Added ROOT(account, num) account manipulation function to the shell.


2015-12-02

  - Fixed issue #84: The sorting of entries from multiple files was incorrectly
    placed, due to recent changes merged from the booking branch.

  - Fixed a bug deleting the load cache (was using an invalid filename).


2015-11-29

  - Made the pickle load cache enabled by default. This means you can now remove
    the BEANCOUNT_LOAD_CACHE environment variable. The load cache will be
    written out automatically, but only if it takes more than the time threshold
    (1 sec) to load a Beancount file. If it takes less than this time, no cache
    is written. (This saves the creation of these pesky crumbs for files it
    doesn't matter for.) If you would like to always disable the load cache, set
    the environment variable BEANCOUNT_DISABLE_LOAD_CACHE. I don't recommend
    it--this works well and for large files makes loading much, much faster.


2015-11-28

  - Implemented a script used to fetch prices online and output them in
    Beancount input format. This script is able not only to take an explicit
    list of prices to get, but also able to read a Beancount input file and
    figure out the list of commodities held at a particular point in time and
    fetch only those prices. A "price" metadata field on a Commodity directive
    is used to specify how and where to get prices from. It comes with support
    for Google Finance and Yahoo! Finance price sources and the syntax supports
    custom-written Python modules so you can write your own price fetching
    extensions, that integrate with the price fetching tool.

    The new code is located under "src/python/beancount/prices" and this new
    tool is documented in http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/prices.

    (Note: This is brand new code, probably imperfect, but I tried to keep this
    simple yet complex enough to be practical. I've been using a variant of it
    for a while, I'm going to merge this now and use it myself, and I hope it
    works for others.)


2015-11-26

  - I redesigned the portfolio export process in order to (a) simplify it
    greatly (the process was a bit confusing, between the use of three metadat
    fields: "ticker", "export" and "quote"), and (b) to separate it entirely
    from the upcoming price fetching script metadata.

    The new outcome is very similiar, however, except it uses only a SINGLE
    metadata field: "export", and the documentation has been rewritten to
    reflect this:
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mNyE_ONuyEkF_I2l6V_AoAU5HJgI654AOBhHsnNPPqw/edit#

    If you have an existing file, here's what you need to do to it:

    * Remove all the 'quote' metadata. You won't need it.
    * If you have 'ticker' metadata: convert those to 'export'.
    * If you have 'export' metadata: keep it.
    * If you had an 'export' metadata with a "MONEY" spec, move that into the
      'export' field after the symbol to export to.

    The example has been ported, so you can refer to that as well.

    I think the new process is much simpler to understand and the documentation
    shorter and easier to read. It should be a trivial exercise to convert one's
    input file to the newer format.


2015-11-22

  - Removed beancount.core.data.AttrDict and replace it by a regular dict. This
    removes some annoyances when pickling and copying metadata. Metadata is now
    represented by a plain old dict. (Fixes issue #79.)


2015-11-09

  - Implemented a simple pickle-date on beancount.loader.load_file(), which will
    reload the parsed & processed contents of a top-level file if a cache file
    is present and more recent than the file itself, or update the contents of
    the cache after loading if not. (This works a bit like .pyc byte-compilation
    in Python or .elc in Emacs LISP.) This makes the loading of large files
    multiple times ~15x faster, which is a big deal since Beancount has become a
    little bit slow (I need to spend time optimizing at some point).

    This feature is a bit experimental, so for now it only gets turned on if the
    BEANCOUNT_LOAD_CACHE environment variable is set.


2015-10-04

  - Implemented --output=<filename> option for bean-query tool.


2015-10-02

  - Implemented an experimental new Query directive whose purpose is to define
    pre-canned SQL queries in the Beancount file itself and to then build tools
    to automate the generation of reports of those queries.

    For the moment being, I'm just playing with this to convince myself that
    this can be powerful and generic enough to provide more generally. I've
    found myself running specific queries on speific files, e.g., during trips
    and I'd like to automate those to some extend, perhaps replace the script
    code that lives in beancount.plugins.split_expenses with this.

    Anyhow, this is not supported but if you understand this and really want to
    turn it on, set this option in your input file:

      option "experimental_query_directive" "TRUE"

    The directives aren't used anywhere yet, and you'll have to read source code
    to figure out what they look like.


  - Implemented a "reload" command in the shell. Typing "reload" will refresh
    the data from the latest file contents.


2015-09-29

  - Tightened the screws on the Amount() constructor a bit and made changes ini
    order to allow it to accept a sentinel value for MISSING values from the
    parser. Changes to beancount.core.amount.Amount are:

    1. A string for the number is not accepted anymore, that is, Amount(str,
       str) is not supported anymore. Amount() now unconditionally requires a
       Decimal instance, so you must use Amount(Decimal, str). In any case, this
       constrcutros was likely abused only by me in the tests. I'd rather have
       a tighter, less permissive constructor.

    2. The convenience constructor beancount.core.amount.from_string() is now
       officially aliased as beancount.core.amount.A, so you can "from
       beancount.core.amount import A". I now commit to using this constructor
       and converted all the tests to use it. This is great for writing tests.
       Amount really is a fundamental piece that deserves a very short alias
       like this.

    In summary, how to create Amount instances:

    * If you use explicit values, use Amount(Decimal, str), e.g.,
      Amount(D('100.00'), 'USD'), Amount(number, currency)

    * If you need a convenience constructor, use A(str), e.g.,
      A('100.00 USD'), A('32,000 KRW')


2015-09-29

  - Added a new column 'description' to the SQL client in order to produce more
    compact reports.

    Oftentimes the payee is left to an empty value and journals
    have a lot of wasted whitespace. Concatenating the payee and the narration
    in a single field goes a long way towards producing reports that aren't
    nearly as wide. I could have added a CONCAT() function but this is so common
    and convenient that a dedicated 'description' alias is justified. You can
    use it in posting context ("SELECT description ..." or "SELECT ... WHERE
    description ~ '...'") or transaction context ("SELECT ... FROM description ~
    '...'")..


2015-09-27

  - Implemented a plugin that can book price conversions using a particular
    booking method, in this case, FIFO. This idea stemmed from a suggestion I
    made on the mailing-list a few weeks ago, which was to process a particular
    account's price conversions to insert cost basis specifications and in doing
    so to book reducing postings to FIFO order automatically. This could all be
    done via a plugin, so I did it. (See tag {c395de691449} on the mailing-list
    for more context.)

    You can find it under "beancount.plugins.book_conversions". You use it like
    this: first you load the plugin:

      plugin "beancount.plugins.book_conversions" "Assets:Bitcoin,Income:Bitcoin"

    The configuration requires you provide two accounts:

    1. An assets account to process, whereby all price conversions (in any currency)
       occurring in that account will have their cost basis automatically inserted,
       and,

    2. An Income account that is inserted on reducing transactions to absorb the
       profit or loss of the sale.

    Then you book your transactions as simple price conversions, without worrying
    about cost basis, for example, this input:

      2015-09-04 *
        Assets:Bank           -750.00 USD
        Assets:Bitcoin       3.000000 BTC @ 250.00 USD

      2015-09-05 *
        Assets:Bank           -780.00 USD
        Assets:Bitcoin       3.000000 BTC @ 260.00 USD

      2015-09-20 *
        Assets:Bitcoin       -2.000000 BTC @ 300.00 USD
        Expenses:Something

      2015-09-21 *
        Assets:Bitcoin       -2.000000 BTC @ 310.00 USD
        Expenses:Something

      2015-09-22 *
        Assets:Bitcoin       -2.000000 BTC @ 330.00 USD
        Expenses:Something

    Would get translated by the plugin into the equivalent of this:

      2015-09-04 *
        Assets:Bitcoin  3.000000 BTC {250.00 USD} @ 250.00 USD
          trades: "trade-ff4c3e592147,trade-6b9c8689ed50"
        Assets:Bank      -750.00 USD

      2015-09-05 *
        Assets:Bitcoin  3.000000 BTC {260.00 USD} @ 260.00 USD
          trades: "trade-91e2245de593,trade-d622a89c614d"
        Assets:Bank      -780.00 USD

      2015-09-20 *
        Assets:Bitcoin          -2.000000 BTC {250.00 USD} @ 300.00 USD
          trades: "trade-ff4c3e592147"
        Income:Bitcoin      -100.00000000 USD
        Expenses:Something   600.00000000 USD

      2015-09-21 *
        Assets:Bitcoin          -1.000000 BTC {250.00 USD} @ 310.00 USD
          trades: "trade-6b9c8689ed50"
        Assets:Bitcoin          -1.000000 BTC {260.00 USD} @ 310.00 USD
          trades: "trade-91e2245de593"
        Income:Bitcoin      -110.00000000 USD
        Expenses:Something   620.00000000 USD

      2015-09-22 *
        Assets:Bitcoin          -2.000000 BTC {260.00 USD} @ 330.00 USD
          trades: "trade-d622a89c614d"
        Income:Bitcoin      -140.00000000 USD
        Expenses:Something   660.00000000 USD

    Note that the price annotations are kept as in the input file. The plugin only
    inserts the cost basis and splits postings where required.

    Secondly, a unique trade identifier is allocated for each matching pair of
    postings that were booked and is added to the metadata of those postings.
    Its value is a comma-separated list. This metadata is useful because it
    allows you to load the entries and from it, to build a list of trades to
    produce a suitable report for reporting.

    So the plugin also contains code to do this. You can invoke it as a main
    program, like this:

      python3 -m beancount.plugins.book_conversions <filename.beancount>

    On the file above, it should generate the following output, which I believe is
    the report you're really after for reporting purposes:

       Units  Currency  Cost Currency    Buy Date  Buy Price   Sell Date  Sell Price     P/L
    --------  --------  -------------  ----------  ---------  ----------  ----------  ------
    2.000000       BTC            USD  2015-09-04     250.00  2015-09-20      300.00  100.00
    1.000000       BTC            USD  2015-09-04     250.00  2015-09-21      310.00   60.00
    1.000000       BTC            USD  2015-09-05     260.00  2015-09-21      310.00   50.00
    2.000000       BTC            USD  2015-09-05     260.00  2015-09-22      330.00  140.00
    --------  --------  -------------  ----------  ---------  ----------  ----------  ------

    Use the '--format=csv' option if you want to produce output suitable for
    including in a spreadsheet. If you need to customize the output further, see the
    source code (file:book_conversions.py). It is not possible to generate this list
    of trades using the SQL client yet, to change the output columns you would have
    to create a standalone script; you can copy just the main() function in the
    plugin if you need to do that and import the rest. (Note: The function that
    extracts the list of matches provides both the posting and its parent
    Transaction object, so you can output data from the transaction if you want,
    e.g. the narration of the selling transaction.)


2015-09-14

  - Merged more changes to beancount.el (Emacs support) by Stefan Monnier:
    * Use syntax-tables for comments and strings.
    * Make ido use optional in Emacs config.
    * Quote filenames on command lines
    Thank you Stefan!


2015-09-12

  - Added to beancount.plugins.split_expenses a new script that is able to
    generate the typical kinds of reports you would need to provide to
    participants in a shared project or travel on their specific expenses and
    contributions, as well as a breakdown of their expenses per category
    (expenses account) and final balances for each participants. Invoke it like
    this:

      python3 -m beancount.plugins.split_expenses <filename>

    The script lives in the same file as the split_expenses plugin, because it
    is tightly related to it. It presumes the input file will process through
    this plugin. Try to run it on the example files under
    beancount/examples/sharing.

  - Added a new file "examples/sharing/duxbury2015.beancount" which contains a
    new example of sharing expenses on a trip between three people.

  - Starter cleanup of beancount.el contributed by Stefan Monnier. More changes
    to come, this is basically a no-op patch. It just moves code around and
    makes other such cosmetic changes to silence some compiler warnings, prepare
    for subsequent changes, better follow coding conventions etc. Detail:

    * beancount.el: Add some standard file headers, license, and
      sectioning comments.  Sprinkle a few FIXMEs while I'm here.
      (beancount-font-lock-defaults): Rename from beancount-font-lock-keywords,
      since this corresponds to font-lock-keywords and not to
      font-lock-defaults.
      (beancount-directive-names, beancount-font-lock-keywords,
      beancount-accounts):  Move variables before their first use (to silence
      the compiler).
      (beancount-mode-map): Use a proper defvar instead of define-minor-mode's
      half-broken :keymap.
      (beancount-mode): Merge the make-local-variables into their corresponding
      `set'.
      (beancount-accounts): Move make-variable-buffer-local to top-level since
      it's a global operation.
      (beancount): Declare this group, already used in define-minor-mode.
      (beancount-hash-keys): Mark unused arg `v' with an underscore.
      (beancount-transaction-set-flag): Don't use replace-string (designed for
      interactive use) from Elisp.
      (beancount-for-line-in-region): Use copy-marker and eobp.
      (beancount-align-numbers): Break lines to avoid hiding arguments.
      (compilation-read-command): Declare variable to silence byte-compiler.


2015-09-06

  - Filter out platform-specific comments from the code generated by GNU Bison,
    in order to avoid unnecessary diffs when I switch between Linux and Mac OS X.


2015-09-05

  - Changed the semantics of the account_rounding account, so that it matches
    that of the other account options, that is, they all specify a sub-account
    of the Equity account. So if you had

      option "account_rounding" "Equity:RoundingError"

    in your input file, change this to:

      option "account_rounding" "RoundingError"

    To ease the transition, the parser now checks if the first component is one
    of the five categories and if so, issues a warning and removes the prefix.

    (One side-effect of this change is that the rounding error account may only
    be an Equity account, but I'm hoping this won't be a problem for anyone.)


2015-08-31

  - The column "weight" was broken; fixed by yagebu@.


2015-08-30

  - Fixed a very minor bug in split_expenses plugin whereby the generated
    postings did not contain the __automatic__ metadata field, and in some
    particular situations, their automatically calculated values would end up
    being used for inferring the tolerances.


2015-08-15

  - Changed the semantics of the parsing stage, in a fairly profound way.
    This should have no visible changes to users, but people writing scripts
    should revise their code if they were using
    beancount.parser.parser.parse_*() functions.

    Just to be clear: beancount.loader.load_*() has not changed. If you just use
    the loader, there are no changes. Changes are only at the parser level.

    Here's what's going on and why: The parser used to carry out interpolation
    of missing numbers on postings for each transaction locally, while parsing
    the transactions. This was done by calling by calling
    beancount.core.interpolate.balance_incomplete_postings(), here:
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/ee2073aae080aaa8e260abe8a501abf872948f0e/src/python/beancount/parser/grammar.py?at=default#grammar.py-803

    Loading a list of entries was carried out in two steps:

                  ,-----------------------load----------------------.
                       (recursively)
                 ,---------------------.   ,---------.   ,------------.
      (input)--->| parse + interpolate |-->| plugins |-->| validation |--> entries
                 `---------------------'   `---------'   `------------'

    First, the parser would run on the input and process all the input files
    recursively (processing includes). "Interpolation", the process of filling
    in missing numbers, was carried out at that stage, during parsing, and only
    locally, that is, for each transaction in isolation. "Booking" of lots, that
    is, selecting which of an account's inventory lots to match and reduce, was
    explicit. This booking could not take advantage of the accumulated
    inventories in order to vary its behavior. You had to specify the entire lot
    information unambiguously.

    After this, in a second stage, the plugins were run on the entries and a
    final validation step was run at the end.

    To implement the booking proposal
    (http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/proposal-booking), we want for the user to
    be able to provide a partial specification of lots to be matched against an
    account's accumulated inventory at the date the transaction is to be
    applied. The idea is that if there is no ambiguity, the user should be able
    to specify very little information about a lot (for example if there is a
    single lot in the account when processing the transaction an empty spec of
    "{}" should be sufficient). Moreover, where the specification is ambiguous,
    we also want to support automatic selection of lots according a method
    specified by the user, e.g., FIFO booking, LIFO booking, etc.

    For this to work, we need to have parsed all the inputs to some sort of
    incomplete specification, a representation of inputs that hasn't yet been
    resolved to specific lots, in order to carry out booking. The parser has
    been modified to output such incomplete postings:

              ,-------------------------load-------------------------.
               (recursively)
                 ,-------.   ,-------------.   ,---------.   ,------------.
      (input)--->| parse |-->|   booking   |-->| plugins |-->| validation |--> entries
                 `-------'   |      +      |   `---------'   `------------'
                             | interpolate |
                             `-------------'
                        incomplete
                         entries

    Because "interpolation" runs on the result of specific lot values, "booking"
    must run before it, and so they are inter-related. Thus, booking and
    inteprolation has been moved to a dedicated step that runs on the list of
    incomplete entries and resolves them to the regular entries to be processed
    further by plugins and validation.

    This also has a nice side-effect: the booking step is where all the
    complexity is, and it is now isolated and I will be able to test and
    experiment on it in isolation. This is where all the fun will be.

    A description of the incomplete specifications output by the parser can be
    found here in the parser.py file, this is the description of the
    intermediate state of postings whose lots haven't yet been matched and
    resolved to specific inventory lots:
    https://bitbucket.org/blais/beancount/src/18282452e265959b69d3d10c6d9cf32e5815c522/src/python/beancount/parser/parser.py?at=booking

    Essentially, a posting's 'lot' attribute contains a "LotSpec" tuple instead
    of a "Lot" tuple, and several numbers may be left unfilled (for interpolate
    values). I don't imagine anyone will ever have to manipulate such
    intermediate entries, only the booking code.

    The previous booking algorithm has been moved to the booking stage and the
    semantics should be identical to what they used to be. This is still the
    default algorithm--it just runs in its own dedicated stage, still operating
    locally on each transation. You should observe no difference in behaviour.

    I've merged these changes now in order to minimize the differences between
    the booking and default branches and because I was able to do it without
    changing any of the semantics (despite the large number of lines and tests
    modified). This was a necessary refactoring. Because that code is now
    isolated to its own stage I should be able to begin implementing the more
    complex state-dependent booking algorithms in the 'booking' branch. (I'm
    excited about this.) I could even implement different booking heuristics and
    switch between them.

    Because the parser used to spit out regular, complete entries,
    parser.parsedoc() was used in much of the tests instead of loader.loaddoc(),
    so that many of those tests would not have to concern themselves with making
    sure the input passed the validation stage run by the loader. For example,
    creating Open directives just to create some Transaction test object wasn't
    necessary in the tests. All of those tests had to be revised and I made them
    all depend on beancount.loader.load_*() instead of the now weakened
    parser.parse_*() functions which output incomplete, unbooked entries. This
    cleans up the dependencies a bit as well. If you wrote your own unit tests
    and were using parser.parsedoc(), you should convert them to use
    loader.loaddoc(). In order for this change not to go unnoticed (and for
    naming consistency with parse_string() and parse_file()) I'll probably
    rename parser.parsedoc() to parser.parse_doc() and ditto with the loader.

    (Note: In some cases I've had to specifically setup the input of some tests
    in "raw" plugin processing mode to avoid triggering some unwanted and
    unrelated errors. I'm tempted to remove even more from the default plugins.
    This may happen in a future CL.)


  - Renamed beancount.parser.parser.parsedoc() to parse_doc() and
    beancount.loader.loaddoc() to load_doc(), for consistency with the other
    parse_*() and load_*() functions. Kept a stub that will issue a warning if
    you use it.


2015-07-23

  - In the conversion to the new booking syntax, I had inadventently removed
    support for the total cost "{{ ... }}" syntax. I brought this back next to
    the new booking syntax, and uncommented tests that had been made to skip.


2015-07-21

  - Merged ongoing work from the 'booking' branch that will eventually change
    the semantics of inventory booking; in the interest of a smooth transition,
    and for me to be able to use either branch interchangeably, I introduced a
    few changes that should have no user-visible effect on 'default':

    * The parser.parse_string() and parser.parse_file() routines don't
      interpolate anymore. For this reason, the tests all had to be adjusted not
      to include interpolation. The interpolation of incomplete postings
      (grammar.interpolation()) has moved to a separate phase and is now run by
      loader._load() *AFTER* parsing. This is key to implementing fuzzy matching
      semantics for matching reducing lots: we need to have all the incomplete
      transactions parsed and sorted in order to select matching lots in date
      order.

      This only affects you if you wrote scripts against the parser
      interface directly (this is highly unlikely).

    * For writing unit tests, parser.parsedoc() and loader.loaddoc() are now
      decorator factories. This allowed me to add options to parser.parsedoc()
      to perform interpolation, and when not specified, to check that entries
      with interpolation are not present in the tests. Also, I coudl merge the
      functionality of parser.parsedoc_noerrors() and loader.loaddoc_noerrors()
      in their respective equivalents. The docstring tests now validate that
      there are no errors in the docstrings by default. This makes the tests
      tighter (a few bugs in the tests themselves were found and fixed).

    * The new syntax for cost specification that will be in effect for the
      inventory booking proposal is now supported. The syntax is
      backward-compatible with the previous one. Previously, the following
      syntaxes were supported for specifying the cost and optionally a lot
      acquisition date:

        Assets:Investments    1 HOOL {123.00 USD}
        Assets:Investments    1 HOOL {123.00 USD / 2013-07-20}

      Instead of these options, the new syntax supports a comma-separated list
      of cost-specifiers which can be one of

        <cost>       -> e.g. 123.00 USD
        <lot-date>   -> e.g. 2015-07-20
        <label>      -> e.g. "first-lot"
        <merge-cost> -> e.g. *

      In order to keep current input working, either a comma (,) or a slash (/)
      is supported to separate the components. This is valid:

        Assets:Investments    1 HOOL {2013-07-20 / 123.00 USD / "first-lot"}

      Those can be provided in any order. For example, these are all also valid
      syntaxes for cost:

        Assets:Investments    1 HOOL {}
        Assets:Investments    1 HOOL {"first-lot"}
        Assets:Investments    1 HOOL {2013-07-20, 123.00 USD}
        Assets:Investments    1 HOOL {2013-07-20, "first-lot"}
        Assets:Investments    1 HOOL {*}
        Assets:Investments    1 HOOL {*, 123.00 USD}

      Moreover, the cost amount now supports a compound amount that is expressed
      not in terms of each unit of the currency, but in terms of the total
      amount over all units, for example, this is how you could fold in the cost
      of a commission:

        Assets:Investments    1 HOOL {123.00 # 9.95 USD}

      The syntax for a compound amount follows this pattern:

          [<per-unit-cost>] # [<total-cost>] <currency>

      The numbers are both optional. If no '#' separator is present, the total
      cost component is assumed to be zero. This will eventually subsume the
      {{...}} total cost syntax, by specifying only the total cost portion of
      the compound amount:

        Assets:Investments    100 HOOL {# 12300.00 USD}

      Of course, this combines with the other spec formats, so this is valid:

        Assets:Investments    1 HOOL {123.00 # 9.95 USD, 2015-07-22}

      Finally, while the new syntax is supported in the parser, the old
      semantics for inventory lot specification is still in order. If you
      provide an unsupported combination of lot specifiers (e.g., you use a
      label, a compound amount, or a merge-cost marker), an error will be issued
      accordingly.

      So just use the cost and date as previously; I will bring in new semantics
      incrementally, semantics that will take advantage of this new syntax. I
      will try to do so in a way that minimizes changes.

  - I removed forwarded symbols from beancount.parser. Generally, in order to be
    able to mock functions, you should always import packages, not symbols.


2015-07-20

  - Numbers rendered from bean-query are now rendered using the display context
    inferred from the input file. This means numbers are rounded nicely, using
    the most common precision seen in the input file.

  - I fixed a bug on writing UTF-8 output to the console on Mac OS X and how it
    interacts with the 'less' pager.


2015-07-12

  - Implemented support for arithmetic operations: +, -, *, / and parenthesis
    groupings are now supported, anywhere that a number can be seen in the input
    file, including postings, costs & prices, and balance numbers.


2015-07-12

  - Changed how web & report rendering code renders numbers so that it uses the
    DisplayContext inferred from the numbers in the input file. Numbers in the
    reports were previously using the default precision and that led to all
    sorts of inconsistencies. The numbers are now rendered using the most common
    precision which has been seen in the input files. (This work had been
    planned for a while, as part of converting everything to use the
    DisplayContext. Next up will be converting the shell's rendering routines.)


2015-07-11

  - WARNING: API CHANGES AHEAD. If you wrote plugins, you will need to remove
    the 'entry' parameter to constructors of Posting().

    I removed the Posting.entry back-reference of Postings to their owning
    Transaction objects. This makes programmatically creating our data
    structures much more straight-forward and avoids us having to run pirouettes
    around which object to create first. It also removes all manners of "fixing
    up" transactions and removes one ultimatley unnecessary degree of freedom
    from plugins outputs: we don't have to check that the plugins generate
    objects with correct back-references. It also makes the documentation
    simpler: I won't have to explain backreferences and how to deal with them.
    Finally, it avoids the circular reference which could potentially make
    Python's GC do some work for no other reason.

    This happened because it occurred to me that the only really important place
    where back-references were used were in the beancount.core.realization code,
    and that in the RealAccount objects I could easily replace the Posting
    instances in lists of "postings or entries" into a new tuple object
    "TxnPosting" that contains a reference to the parent transaction and a
    reference to the posting. This voids the need for a back-reference, and
    makes the API really straightforward.


  - WARNING: USER-LEVEL CHANGES FOLLOW. I repatriated the following optional
    plugins to the beancount.plugins package, so that all the plugins are in the
    same place:

       beancount.ops.auto_accounts   -> beancount.plugins.auto_accounts
       beancount.ops.implicit_prices -> beancount.plugins.implicit_prices

    This is so that the "beancount.ops" package contains only plugins run by
    default (non-optional), and so that the "beancount.plugins" only contains
    optional plugins the user must provide.

    In doing so, I also made the "implicit_prices" plugin NOT INCLUDED BY
    DEFAULT. This plugin creates automatically Price directives for all Postings
    which have a @ <price> annotation, thus feeding those prices into the price
    database. If you want to keep this behaviour -- and you probably should --
    you need to add the following in your input file:

      plugin "beancount.plugins.implicit_prices"

    (I'm considering moving move of the default plugins to be optional, in
    particular, beancount.ops.documents, not sure yet.)


2015-07-05

  - Implemented support for parsing strings from files in various encodings.
    Only string objects encoded in non-ASCII are supported, e.g., payee,
    narrations, description, etc. This means the account names are still
    restricted to ASCII, in particular. This works with UTF8 encoding (tested),
    latin1 encoding (tested), and probably more. The support is at the lexer
    level. You may now supply an 'encoding' parameter to parser.parse_file(),
    parser.parse_string(), loader.load_file(), loader.load_string() functions.
    Passing in an invalid encoding should not mail it fail (though the contents
    of the strings will be empty). Unit tests for all those cases have been
    added.

  - Completely reviewed all lexer and grammar error handling code. The parser
    code used to bail out with abort() on an unhandled exception and dump core
    after issuing its error message (this is ugly but was never a big issue
    since this occurred pretty rarely). All errors are now handled gracefully
    (invalid lexer token, exception raised in lexer builder, invalid gramamr
    rule, exception raised in grammar builder Python code). A comprehensive
    suite of unit tests has been built to catch all these. You should never
    experience a core dump anymore. A number of other unexpected cases has also
    been dealt with.

  - The lexer used to have a fixed-size buffer for parsing its strings. The
    buffer is now dynamically allocated. Lexing should also be slightly faster.

  - Mmeory management for the parser has been reviewed. Memory clean up for
    temporaries generated during parsing has been reinstated (it was disabled
    somehow) and cleanup rules are invoked even in the case of errors. This may
    make the parser somewhat slower.


2015-07-02

  - Built support for setuptools and rolled back changes. Setuptools is broken
    beyond what I can bear. Forget this. You'll have to install dependencies by
    hand. It's a one-liner, like this:

      pip3 install python-dateutil bottle ply lxml


2015-07-01

  - Wrote a post-mortem/assessment doc on LedgerHub, detailed future plans for
    LedgerHub and plans to eventually merge the codebase into Beancount again.
    See: http://furius.ca/ledgerhub/doc/postmortem



2015-06-27

  - Complete the design doc and made it public.


2015-06-26

  - Created a generic script that can be used to automate the upload of
    arbitrary CSV files to a Google Spreadsheet. This can be used along with the
    holdings reports in order to create a spreadsheet tracking your assets.

    Unfortunately, this script has to be written in Python 2.x, because of
    the unavailability of the gdata-python-client library which is not available
    at this time for Python 3.x. The script is self-contained. If you want
    to use this, you must install the following libraries in your Python 2.x
    install:

    * gdata-python-client
    * oauth2client
    * httplib2


2015-06-25

  - Posting objects now have (filename, lineno) in their metadata. This could
    potentially be helpful for people who want to insert text programmatically
    in their input file without having to write their own parser.
    See: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/beancount/zNCFk-YGdr8/8P2_vGGH9xoJ


2015-06-15

  - All the code to bake a static HTML archive of a bean-web interface has been
    rewritten.

    * There used to be a number of bugs caused by the wget tool. These bugs have
      been fixed.

    * The new code does not depend on wget -- Beancount does not require wget
      anymore. Explicit code to do web scraping has been implemented. On the
      other hand, a new dependency is introduced: lxml. This dependency was
      already required for development and install in the same way as all the
      other dependencies: using pip3. Should be a breeze to install on all
      platforms.

    * A verification layer has been tacked on after the web scraping step to
      check that there are no dangling links.

    * Intentionally skipped links are now converted to plain text, such that
      there are no dangling links for pages we aren't saving (these just used
      to be ignored).

    I repeat: Beancount does not depend on wget anymore.
    Please install lxml with: "pip3 install lxml"


  - The 'exportpf' report which is used to produce OFX that can be imported in
    Google Finance now issues a warning if you did not provide either 'ticker'
    or 'export' metadata for holdings that get exported. The reason for the new
    adminition is that it trips up the OFX import and when Google Finance sees
    a ticker it does not understand, the import fails. At least with the warning
    we're telling the user they should be providing tickers or export directives
    for all their commodities if they export the portfolio.


2015-06-10

  - Removed dependency on curses. If you don't have curses, everything should
    work fine now, errors are being caught. Curses was only used to provide good
    default values for rendering tables in terminals on e.g. bean-report
    journal and to decide whether to use a pager in multi-page bean-query.
    The default values are fixed if curses isn't available, e.g. 80 chars wide,
    but as previously, you can override them manually. I also removed the
    dependency from checkdeps and from the install document.


2015-06-09

  - Rewrote the Installation Instructions document completely to make it
    simpler. Some users had found it daunting.
    http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/install

  - Tested Windows installation using Cygwin and added it to the installation
    instructions.
    http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/install


2015-06-07

  - Moved the following representation related symbols to their own module:

      beancount.core.amount.D          ->  beancount.core.number.D
      beancount.core.amount.Decimal    ->  beancount.core.number.Decimal
      beancount.core.amount.ZERO       ->  beancount.core.number.ZERO
      beancount.core.amount.ONE        ->  beancount.core.number.ONE
      beancount.core.amount.HALF       ->  beancount.core.number.HALF
      beancount.core.amount.round_to   ->  beancount.core.number.round_to

    I also moved the tests. All the code specifically related to numbers is
    now in beancount.core.number. I also removed the relative imports, as
    Ledgerhub is importing from the Beancount source code now.

    This is not a user-visible change. However, if you wrote scripts against
    the codebase, you will need to rename your imports. In the meantime I added
    stubs which issue a warning if you import from the obsoleted names.


  - Moved documentation scripts from experiments to the main Beancount codebase.
    There is a new package for it: beancount.docs. These codes are used to maintain
    the Beancount documentation and there is common code for authentication in there,
    code that I plan to use for automating the exporting ot portfolios.

    This introduces some optional dependencies:

    * google-api-python-client
    * oauth2client
    * httplib2

    These are optional, and at the moment none of the actual Beancount tools
    make any use of them. I moved this into the main Beancount codes because
    the common authentication code will be used to export portfolios directly
    to a Google spreadsheet in Google Drive, which will be super convenient
    to build custom portfolio tracking views.


2015-06-06

  - Added an 'inferred_tolerance_multiplier' option to allow the user to adjust
    the magnitude of the inferred tolerance.

    When the tolerance values aren't specified explicitly via the
    'default_tolerance' option, the tolerance is inferred from the numbers in
    the input file. For example, if a transaction has posting with a value
    like '32.424 CAD', the tolerance for CAD will be inferred to be 0.001
    times some multiplier. This is the muliplier value.

    We normally assume that the institution we're reproducing this posting
    from applies rounding, and so the default value for the multiplier is
    0.5, that is, half of the smallest digit encountered.

    You can now customize this multiplier by changing this option, typically
    expanding it to account for amounts slightly beyond the usual tolerance,
    for example, if you deal with institutions with bad of unexpected rounding
    behaviour.

  - Promoted the 'experiment_infer_tolerance_from_cost' option to
    'infer_tolerance_from_cost': not an experiment anymore. See thread on
    mailing-list w/ mharris. This feature works well and actually solves real
    problems for users.

    A corresponding section has been added in the documentation at
    http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/tolerances


2015-06-04

  - When using the 'experiment_infer_tolerance_from_cost' option, the inferred
    tolerance is now expanded to include the SUM of all maximum rounding errors
    from postings held at cost, not just the maximum. Users with multiple
    rounding events in a single transactions could occur rounding that many
    times. We assume no more rounding events than the number of postings held at
    cost.

  - I wrote a new document to explain how to deal with restricted stock units
    vesting events:
    http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/vesting


2015-06-03

  - bean-doctor context now outputs weight and residual numbers at their full
    precision instead of their rounded one.


2015-06-02

  - Created a new document to keep track of user contributions:
    http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/contrib


2015-05-30

  - Converted the Syntax Cheat Sheet to a Google Doc and removed it here.

  - Added a check to bake the source code's checksums into the C extension
    module and upon loading beancount.parser.parser check that the checksums
    match. This automatically issues a warning on all programs that use the
    parser if the compiled extension module is out-of-date and the user needs to
    rebuild. This should explain the occasional unexpected situation where the
    extension module doesn't match the Python code, for those running from
    source or during development and in switching branches.

  - Added an experimental boolean option: 'experiment_infer_tolerance_from_cost'
    that expands the inferred tolerance to include values inferred from the cost
    and price amounts on those cost and price currencies.

    Here is the doc for it:

      Enable an EXPERIMENTAL feature that expands the maximum tolerance inferred
      on transactions to include values on cost currencies inferred by postings
      held at-cost or converted at price. Those postings can imply a tolerance
      value by multiplying the smallest digit of the unit by the cost or price value
      and taking half of that value.

      For example, if a posting has an amount of "2.345 RGAGX {45.00 USD}"
      attached to it, it implies a tolerance of 0.001 x 45.00 / 2 = 0.045 USD
      and this is added to the mix to enlarge the tolerance allowed for units of
      USD on that transaction. All the normally inferred tolerances (see
      http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/tolerances) are still taken into account.
      Enabling this flag only makes the tolerances potentially wider.

      WARNING: This feature may go away in the future. It is an exploration to see
      if it is truly useful.

  - Added a dependency check for 'curses' library and updated documentation.
    This is for OpenSuse which packages curses separately.


2015-05-22

  - Fixed a simple bug (#47) where the default value used for legacy tolerances
    wasn't being initialized properly and added a test for it.


2015-05-20

  - Fixed a potential important bug (#48) just introduced a few days ago whereby
    enabling the 'account_rounding' option would inadvertently disable balance
    checks. Thanks to Matthew Harris for finding and reporting it.

  - Added a 'dedent' option to both beancount.parser.parser.parse_string() and
    beancount.loader.load_string(). This is a convenience for writing quick
    tests.


2015-05-17

  - MAJOR CHANGES: Precision and tolerances in Beancount have been entirely
    revamped. The logic used to compute tolerances on transaction balances and
    balance assertions is new. This previously discussed proposal:

      http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/proposal-rounding

    has been implemented. The new behaviour is documented here:

      http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/tolerances


    Here is a high-level summary of changes (see doc above for details):

    * The tolerance used for transaction balances is inferred automatically from
      the amounts on the transactions themselves. When not possible, a default
      tolerance is looked up from values you can provide (as well as a global
      default).

    * There is a new 'default_tolerances' option to provide tolerances to be
      used used when it cannot be inferred automatically. You use it like this:

        option "default_tolerance" "*:0.005"
        option "default_tolerance" "INR:0.5"
        ...

    * The 'tolerance' option has been deprecated. It now has no effect.

    * Balance assertions and Pad directives use a similar inference mechanism,
      where the tolerance is based on the precision of the expected number in
      the input.

    * Rounding errors may be automatically posted to a special account (new
      postings are inserted during parsing where necessary). This is disabled by
      default; you enable this by setting the new 'account_rounding' option to
      the account you want the rounding errors to be posted to:

        option "account_rounding" "Equity:Rounding-Errors"

    * These changes may cause some of your transactions to report as not
      balancing, because the tolerances and now inferred automatically and the
      inferred tolerances may be smaller than the fixed value we used
      previously. YOU NEED TO MAKE SUITABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO YOUR INPUT FILE.
      However, because this might cause some minor disruption, I have provided
      an option to allow users to revert Beancount to its previous tolerance
      behavior for a few months:

        option "use_legacy_fixed_tolerances" "TRUE"

    * There is a new EXPERIMENTAL feature which makes Beancount accept an
      explicit tolerance value on balance assertions, like this:

        YYYY-MM-DD balance <account>  <number> ~ <tolerance> <currency>

      For example,

        2015-05-17 balance Assets:Vanguard   23.2134 ~ 0.002 RGAGX

      By default, this feature is not enabled; this is being tested out and it
      might go away eventually. To enable it, add the following experiment flag:

        option "experiment_explicit_tolerances" "TRUE"


  - The 'plugin' option has now been deprecated and will issue a warning if you
    use it. You must now use the 'plugin' directive instead.

  - The parser now supports boolean types, with this syntax: TRUE, FALSE. This
    can be useful to set metadata fields.

  - Postings that were inserted automatically have some metadata set on them to
    distinguish this fact ('__automatic__').



2015-05-12

  - Allow currency names up to 24 characters (not 12). This is often required
    for people using financial options.


2015-05-11

  - Added parsing of boolean types: TRUE, FALSE will produce values of
    Python "True" and "False". This is useful to used as metadata values.

  - Removed extraneous reference release in key_value_value in parser.


2015-05-03

  - Added Equity to the list of accounts that count as proceeds for
    beancount.plugins.sellgains plugin. This is so that old transactions
    may use an unknown equity account and still pass the sellgains check.


2015-04-19

  - Fixed a bug with the pad directive that did not look for account name
    boundaries when looking at a parent account.

  - In output of bean-doctor context, now print the residual amount.


2015-04-18

  - Implemented limited support for arithmetic expressions. For now, only
    support division. So A/B where "A" and "B" are numbers should now work.

    In order to support full arithmetic expressions, we need to reimplement
    the lexer in order to distinguish between "*" as a TAG or as a multiplication
    token, and operator precedence to deal with terms vs. exprs. This will
    probably be done soon. (I need division for a particular task right now, so
    it is being added in in a backwards-compatilble way).


2015-04-18

  - Merged a new plugin (beancount.plugins.sellgains) that automatically
    cross-checks the purchase price of a lot against all the other legs that are
    in non-income accounts. This is useful to verify the correctness of @ price
    annotations on reductions at cost, because not only the transactions have to
    balance in cost (that is, including the income portion), they then also have
    to balance without the income portion, using the price you attached (if you
    somehow reported an incorrect price you will get an error).

    This is best explained with an example:

      1999-07-31 * "Sell"
        Assets:US:BRS:Company:ESPP          -81 ADSK {26.3125 USD} @ 26.4375 USD
        Assets:US:BRS:Company:Cash      2141.36 USD
        Expenses:Financial:Fees            0.08 USD
        Income:US:Company:ESPP:PnL      -10.125 USD

    The regular balance verification checks all the legs against the cost basis:

      -18 x 26.3125 + 2141.36 + 0.08 - 10.125 = 0 USD

    This is the default behavior, and is still required. With the sellgains
    plugin, an additional check also verifies that

      -18 x 26.4375 + 2141.36 + 0.08 = 0 USD

    Note how the price (26.4375) is used instead of the cost basis, and how
    income legs are ignore in the calculation.

    Transactions with reductions without a price and without an income leg will
    be ignored, so only those which can be verified will be verified.


2015-04-13

  - Beancount now allows the cost to the set to zero. This is useful for stock
    options that one receives from an employer that have no value attached to
    them.

    Additionally, I'm considering allowing negative cost as well, which may be
    necessary to handle adjusted cost bases, but I haven't added this just yet.
    I'm not 100% convinced (adjustments are probably always upward).


2015-04-16

  - Added a new command to bean-doctor: "linked" which prints out all
    transactions linked to the one at a given line number, in a format Emacs can
    grok with filename and location like errors so you can easily navigate
    between the linked transactions.

    Correspondingly, added a "bean-linked" command to the Emacs support mode.


2015-04-13

  - A minor improvment to bean-format has been implemented: Whitespace before
    postings is now automatically normalized to the most frequent spacing
    present in the document. This allows you to be somewhat sloppy on the
    postings themselves when entering new transactions.


2015-02-16

  - Finally completed documentation on how to export your portfolio to Google
    Finance, as
    http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/export,
    or equivalently as
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eZIDRmQZxR6cmDyOJf7U3BnCm4PDMah2twxYFfKPJtM/


2015-02-10

  - Revamped the export-to-OFX report to showcase a more explicit, flexible and
    easily debuggable configuration. Also supports the declaration of money
    instrument equivalents within the file itself. This will be documented here:
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1eZIDRmQZxR6cmDyOJf7U3BnCm4PDMah2twxYFfKPJtM/


2015-02-03

  - Fixed an unreported bug with Emacs support whereby a number appearing within
    a narration string would get aligned along with the other amounts.


2015-02-01

  - Implemented an "include" directive. The include directive does not parse the
    files in order... rather, each parse run on an input file accumulates the
    list of includes to be parsed and processed the includes after parsing the
    file. Because we're order independent, this should work. Note however that
    the options should be set in the root file.

    This is documented here:
    https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wAMVrKIA2qtRGmoVDSUBJGmYZSygUaR0uOMW1GV3YE0/edit#heading=h.86lelow4097r


2015-01-24

  - I created a new branch 'ledgerhub' to provide a version of Beancount that i
    guaranteed to be compatible with LedgerHub.

    Previously, LedgerHub was synchronizing a copy of some of the files under
    beancount.core in order to avoid depending on Beancount. This turned out to
    be difficult to maintain, as Beancount is still evolving relatively fast. So
    I've decided to return to the original state of affairs: LedgerHub will
    depend on a Beancount install in order to reuse its core libraries. (The
    original reason for not doing so was that I thought I'd want to fork
    those core libraries to support Ledger-specific features, but at this point
    it's dubious whether I will need that at all --or whether I couldn't just
    add generic support in Beancount's core libraries themselve to do that-- and
    this will be an easier way to synchronize the two codebases going forward).

    If you're a LedgerHub user, please checkout Beancount at its 'ledgerhub'
    branch and make your PYTHONPATH depend on that.


2015-01-22

  - Added a dependency check for PLY and documented in the Install doc
    (http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/install).


2015-01-18

  - Added a new, optional "Commodity" directive, which can be used to declare
    commodity/currencies/instruments. The real purpose of this optional
    directive is to hang per-commodity meta-data off of them. Some scripts are
    much simplified by being able to define custom attributes for each
    commodity, e.g. "name", "asset-class", "currency-exposure", and such. There
    is a new function beancount.core.getters.get_commodity_map() which can be
    used to gather a map of commodity to metadata.

    You otherwise don't have to add those declarations; the new directive is
    entirely optional and its addition should not break any existing feature
    nor input file. It is an error to insert duplicate Commodity directives
    for the same commodity name. I'm mainly doing this now so I can migrate
    the portfolio dashboard script from experiments into the mainline while
    configuring it using metadata.

    The directive is documented here:
    http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/language#heading=h.a3si01ejc035


  - I added a development dependency on pyflakes and validated all code on
    'default' to pass a flawless pyflakes run.


2015-01-17

  - I added a paragraph about Releases in the Install document. Basically, I
    don't do releases: the "default" branch is stable, just clone on "default"
    and update regularly, I do all "risky" feature development in branches and
    only merge to "default" when fully stable. All major changes on "default"
    are announced in this file.


2015-01-11

  - **IMPORTANT** Fixed an inconsistency with the signs of total cost syntax,
    like this:

        <account>          -1000 USD @@ -1123.24 CAD

    It was required to use the negative sign in order to get the correct value.
    This makes no sense: per-unit cost and price amounts were unsigned, and total
    cost values were only allowed to be positive. Also, Ledger requires all
    costs and prices to be positive/unsigned, which could be confusing for
    Ledger users. I had no particularly good reason to require the same sign
    for total cost: this was only an oversight.

    So I changed this so that total price, like total cost, per-unit price,
    per-unit cost, are all positive/unsigned. An error is now raised i a price
    or cost, total or per-unit, are provided negative. You need to convert your
    input files to unsigned values, like this (for the above example):

        <account>          -1000 USD @@ 1123.24 CAD

    If you pull this change and have negative total prices, your input file will
    break. In order to circumvent the change, you may set the
    BEANCOUNT_ALLOW_NEGATIVE_PRICES environment variable. I will remove this
    workaround in a few months.
    (This bug reported by Matthew Harris.)

  - Fixed a bug when total cost {{...}} syntax was being used with a negative
    number of units: it would raise an error, although it was legal to do so.
    For example, this is legal and was raising an error:

        <account>          -10 MSFT {{455.24 USD}}

    It probably did not show up much because few people use the total cost
    method, and the tests happened only to use positive numbers of units.

  - Fixed issue #5: bug in beancount.plugins.leafonly plugin when posting to a
    non-leaf account that had no Open directive. (This bug reported by Nathan
    Grigg.)


2015-01-04

  - Merged the 'shell' branch into 'default', providing a new tool to extract
    information from a Beancount input file: bean-query. This is the first
    revision of the SQL-like query language for Beancount. Documentation for it
    is available under http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/query.


2014-12-28

  - Merged various functions (in beancount.ops.lifetimes) used to automatically
    compute the date intervals that particular commodities are in used. This is
    intended to be used to write scripts to automatically fetch all the price
    entries needed during the lifetime of a particular Ledger. A script has been
    created under experiments (src/experiments/fetch-missing-prices.py) which
    you should be able to modify to your favourite price fetcher.

  - The 'export_holdings' report now exports an extra holding as a cash
    equivalent mutual fund in order to take into account of the value of
    holdings that could not be converted to symbols the online portfolio
    manager software knows about. The cash position brings the portfolio to
    close to its total value.


2014-12-26

  - Merged the latest version of the 'display_context' branch into 'default'.
    These changes make the DisplayContext object a factory for DisplayFormatter
    objects which are then used to render numbers. This is a little more
    sophisticated than the previous approach and will be reusable in the
    rendering routines for the interactive SQL shell's result.


2014-12-25

  - The 'metadata' branch has been merged into 'default'. Metadata is now
    officially supported in Beancount.

    * Metadata can be created on all directives and postings. An attribute of
      '.meta' can be used to access all parsed metadata. The object is a dict
      which can also have its fields accessed via attributes.

    * The '.source' attribute on all directives has been removed and '.meta' now
      replaces it. The 'filename' and 'lineno' attributes which were previously
      available on the beancount.core.data.Source tuple have been folded into
      the metadata dict under the same names.

    * Metadata values can be of various datatypes and these will be parsed and
      available in Python:

      - Strings
      - Account names (appears as str)
      - Currency (appears as str)
      - Dates (a datetime.date instance)
      - Tags (appears as str)
      - Numbers (a decimal.Decimal instance)
      - Amount (a beancount.core.amount.Amount instance)

    * Attributes without a value will be parsed and have a value of 'None'. If
      an attribute is repeated multiple times, only the first value for this
      attribute will be parsed and retained.

    * Apart from the 'filename' and 'lineno' attributes, no other "special"
      usage of metadata will be made by Beancount. Metadata is intended to be
      for the user to attach arbitrary data to directives. The query language
      will eventually support query arbitrary metadata attributes, but no special
      meaning will be assumed.



2014-12-19

  - Created a new "export_holdings" report type that spits out an OFX format of
    the holdings that can be consumed by external portfolio definition services
    such as Google Finance (for example). This is useful, as it allows you to
    monitor changes in your portfolio from a mobile device.

    Note that in some of these services, a commodity that isn't a valid ticker
    symbol fails the import process. Also, a commodity that is a mutual fund
    recorded in the OFX file as a stock will similar fail the import process. We
    need to find a way to fetch this info from the file itself. When metadata
    will get merged, we should be able to get it from the account names, where
    we could attach a property to the account's corresponding Open directive.

    In the meantime, and as a kludge to start using this right away, place a
    note for each currency (at any date, in any account) with the text in the
    following format:

       YYYY-MM-DD note <account> "Export <commodity>: IGNORE"
       YYYY-MM-DD note <account> "Export <commodity>: MUTUAL_FUND"

    This will get removed later.



2014-12-07

  - After much more work on the SQL query language (in 'shell' branch), I need
    to access Inventory positions by index, so I removed the getitem ([])
    operator from Inventory, which was unused in the codebase. (If you have
    scripts this *may* affect you; translate calls to [] into calls to
    .get_position()).



2014-11-29

  - Completed work on calculating returns (merged branch 'returns' into
    default). I created a new package called "projects" to hold these special
    tasks, those that don't integrate in the plugins framework, and created a
    beancount.projects.returns library that can be inovoked as a script, like
    this:

      python3 -m beancount.projects.returns <filename.beancount> ...

    For the arguments, you will have to read the docstring. You essentially need
    to provide two or three regular expressions to list the set of accounts
    that define you portfolio as well as other lists of accounts that should be
    considered internal flows. See the docstring for details. I will eventually
    move much of that explanation into a Google Doc and detail it in more depth.

    There is also a script that runs it on the example beancount file, as well
    as examples in the unit tests.


2014-11-27

  - Started the "booking" branch which will implement the
    http://furius.ca/beancount/doc/proposal-booking proposal. The first step was
    to add an argument to the Open directive to specify the default booking
    method to use when there are either 0, 2 or more matching lots in an
    inventory. The only value supported by this are currently "STRICT" (the
    default) or "NONE" which effectively disables inventory booking and is
    equivalent to Ledger's method of accumulating lots. The new syntax looked
    like this and is backward compatible with previous synta for it:

      YYYY-MM-DD open <account>   [<commodities>]  ["<booking-method>"]

    Though the result may be inventories with positive and negative positions in
    the same commodity, this is useful for working with accounts booked at their
    average cost (until we have correct treatment of basis for those with
    dedicated syntax for merging lots). The total number of units and the total
    cost should be correct.

    This state of the 'booking' branch was merged into the 'default' branch,
    which is why it appears in this CHANGE entry.


2014-11-21

  - Merged "metadata" branch into default, Beancount now parses the metadata but
    does not store it anywhere. This was done so that early adopters can start
    to enter metadata right away even if it is not usable yet.


2014-11-13

  - Added a new "beancount.plugins.ira_contribs" module that automatically
    inserts postings for tracking pre-tax money contributions.


2014-11-11

  - The precision of rendered numbers isn't quantized nor subject to hard-coded
    maximums anymore. I cleaned this up. There is a new "DisplayContext" object
    that maintains the most common and maximum precisions to be used to render
    each currency, and this precision is derived automatically from the numbers
    used in the input file (the most common is the mode of the distribution of
    numbers seen). The alignment of the printer's amounts is now also fixed (it
    rendered correct transactions lately but alignment was a little borked), and
    the output is now kept as tightly as possible close to the account names.

  - Numbers don't render with commas by default anymore. There is a new option:
    'render_commas' that you can set to have commas in numbers rendered in all
    the routines that output numbers.


2014-11-09

  - A new directive has been created: "plugin" that accepts the an optional
    plugin-configuration string. Instead of

      option "plugin" "<module>"
      option "plugin" "<module>:<config>"

    Now use:

      plugin "<module>"
      plugin "<module>" "<config>"

    The plugin option will remain functional for a while. The configuration
    string is as previously a free-form string whose meaning is to be defined by
    the plugin itself.

  - The parser now stores the distribution of the precisions of all the numbers
    it parses, and this adds a little bit of overhead (about 4%). With a large
    file, you might notice a little tiny bit of extra slowness. The reason I
    created this is in order to automatically infer reasonable defaults for the
    display precision (used in the SQL shell at the moment).

  - Renamed the 'bean-query' tool to 'bean-report'. There is a good reason for
    this: there is a new tool coming that will provide an command-shell to make
    interactive queries on your ledger contents. This tool will be
    called--appropriately--"bean-query". I decided that the two tools should be
    separate: "bean-report" will be used to render custom-coded reports (nothing
    changes), and "bean-query" will be used to build reports out of SQL-like
    queries. I'm hoping that eventually bean-query functionality will entirely
    subsume bean-report reports, but that is unclear at this point.

  - Made default rendering for changes and balances of HTML reports by units().
    Rendering all the lots was horrible in even moderately complex stock trading
    accounts with a few positions. Now we aggregate by currency ("units").

     In order for the user to be able to view the previously available lot
     detail from the web interface, we now provide a link to the "context",
     which is a link specific to a transaction that renders the balances for all
     the accounts just before the transaction is applied, and just after.

  - (Internal) Renamed beancount.core.complete to beancount.core.interpolate.
    I've been using the term interpolate for a while now, in the docs, and it's
    way more telling than complete.


(Beginning to summarize user-facing changes 2014-11-09.)
