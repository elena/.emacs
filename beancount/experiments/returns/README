This directory contains code which computes returns on a variety of assets, as
recorded by Beancount, fed directly from a Beancount file.

This is work in progress; it does not work in all cases, and needs some serious
review. This code used to be in the main repo, but I've decided to remove it
from the main source code until it's robust enough to work for everyone.
