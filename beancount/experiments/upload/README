Produce a list of holdings to be uploaded to a Google Sheets doc.

This produces a report that is usable for producing various aggregations. It's
somewhat custom, so not in the main codebase yet. I'll eventually move the
functions piecemeal and will attempt to replace this by a SQL query in the end.

The automation of the sheets update is carried out using the update-to-sheets
tool.
